# [World Data League 2021](https://challenges.worlddataleague.com/event/wdl-2021) - Stage 1 - Public Transportation

</div>

<div class="col-12">

According to the [2017 UN’s Global Mobility Report](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/2643Global_Mobility_Report_2017.pdf), it is predicted that by 2030 the annual passenger traffic will exceed 80 trillion passengers-kilometres. That means an increase of 50% compared to 2015, as well as an additional 1.2 billion cars on the road.

As cities grow, there’s an urge for an efficient public transportation system. In this stage, we want to look into this problem from two perspectives:

*   Creating a churn model for public transportation
*   Model an integrated transportation system for senior citizens

##### Churn model for public transports

<div class="card-body">

In this challenge, we want to understand the senior citizens' mobility patterns and their characteristics: We aim to provide better conditions of mobility for our senior citizens, giving them the same opportunities to arrive at their points of interest with affordable and accessible public transport.

##### Model of integrated transports for senior citizens

The goal in this challenge is to create a framework that will allow to measure the increase and decrease the passengers of public transport towards cities that are more inclusive and sustainable.
